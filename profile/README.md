# Di Genoma Lab 
hi 👋! welcome to the Di genoma lab. 
## Short description
We are a Chilean-based research group that combines the development of **new algorithms**, **genome analysis**, and **omics technologies** to study complex biological systems.

# Main Repositories

## Genome Assembly
We have developped the following tools for de novo assembly of genomes: 

1. [Wengan](https://github.com/adigenova/wengan) is an accurate and ultra-fast hybrid genome assembler.
2. [Fast-SG](https://github.com/adigenova/fast-sg) is an alignment-free algorithm for ultrafast scaffolding graph construction from short or long reads.

## Cancer Genomics
We have developed, in conjunction with [IARCbioinfo](https://github.com/IARCbioinfo), the following workflows to study cancer genomes:
1. [purple-nf](https://github.com/digenoma-lab/purple-nf) a nextflow pipeline for somatic Copy Number Variant calling with PURPLE.
2. [sv_somatic_cns](https://github.com/digenoma-lab/sv_somatic_cns) consensus calling of Somatic structural variants from Paired WGS.
3. [ampliconarchitect-nf](https://github.com/digenoma-lab/ampliconarchitect-nf) a nextflow pipeline to discover ecDNA on cancer genomes
4. [nf-gene-fusions](https://github.com/digenoma-lab/nf-gene-fusions) a nextflow pipeline to call somatic mRNA fusions

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
